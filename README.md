# About project

[![Unity version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity%20version-2022.3.16f-57b9d3.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=unity)](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.16)

# Tetris

Tetris is a classic puzzle game that challenges your spatial and logical skills. The goal is to arrange falling shapes called tetrominoes into complete lines that disappear from the board. The game ends when the tetrominoes reach the top of the board and prevent further moves.

## How to play

You can use the following keys to control the tetrominoes:

- A and D arrow keys to move the tetromino horizontally
- Q and E keys to rotate the tetromino. You can use these keys to turn the tetromino counter-clockwise or clockwise
- Down arrow key to speed up the tetromino's fall
- Spacebar to drop the tetromino instantly

You can also use your mouse to click the buttons.

## Scoring

You score points by clearing lines. The more lines you clear at once, the more points you get. For example, clearing one line gives you 10 points, clearing two lines gives you 20 points.

You get extra points depending on the number of cells in the piece. This means that every time you drop a tetromino, you add some points to your score based on how many cells it has.
